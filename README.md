# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

## Project Overview - CodeCuisine Menu Display System

In this coding challenge, you will build a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal is to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click. This challenge will help you apply various JavaScript concepts, including functions, closures, and event handling, to create an interactive menu.

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple menu system for a restaurant website using JavaScript. The menu items are categorized into starters, main courses, and desserts, with the ability to dynamically display them on the webpage. Users can click on menu items to add them to their order, and the total price of the order is updated accordingly.

## Reflections

Ensuring the project effectively demonstrates the use of JavaScript to dynamically generate menu items and handle user interactions.

## Areas of Mastery

- **Setup Project Files**: Linking your CSS and JS files to your HTML document, with ease.
- **Styling**: Use CSS to style your menu and order summary. Make the user interface visually appealing, and ensure that it's responsive and easy to navigate.

## Areas of Improvements

- **Event Handling**: Effective use of event listeners to respond to user interactions and trigger appropriate actions.
- **User Interaction**: Event listeners are added to menu items to allow users to add items to their order with ease.

## Challenges

- **Real-time Updates & Optimization**: Real-time updates are important for a menu display system.
- **Modularity**: Functions such as `displayMenuItems`, `addToOrder`, and `initMenuSystem` are appropriately modularized for better code organization. - Understanding this topic better.

## Overview Learning Experience

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and modular code organisation.
